	<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
	<blockquote>
		This privacy policy is version 1, dated 7th January 2018.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		The <em>Stories Unread</em> newsletter is proudly published by
		<em>Bright Flair Ltd</em>, who take the privacy of the
		newsletter subscribers and visitors to the website very
		seriously. We only take absolutely vital information required to
		offer the service to the subscribers and visitors, and this
		data is handled extremely carefully, as described below.
	</p>

	<h2>What data we collect</h2>
	<p>
		We have no interest in finding out demographic
		analytical information about our subscribers, so we do not
		use any analytics services. We specifically ensure that the
		only third parties that we deal with are hand picked,
		necessary for the function of the newsletter, and heavily
		vetted before using their services.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are only two data points we collect of our subscribers
		and visitors:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Upon subscribing, the visitor will provide us their
			email address to send the newsletter to. We pass this
			information to our email provider (see below) and we
			only store it temporarily in a file on our server for
			one hour to provide a double opt-in mechanism.
		</li>
		<li>
			When visiting the website, the web server will log
			the access which includes the IP and user agent of
			the browser being used. We store no more information
			than what is the default for a web server's normal
			operation.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<strong>Did you notice how we didn't force you to accept
		confusing cookie consent popups when you visited our website?</strong>
		That's because we do not track visitors in any way. We do not
		use tracking cookies in any way. No information about visitors'
		browsers is recorded or sent anywhere. <strong>We are an email
		newsletter about technology, not an evil marketing
		corporation.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The email address that is supplied by subscribers is sent to
		our email processing service, as described below.
	</p>

	<h2>What data we store, and where we store it</h2>
	<p>
		We do not keep persistent records of email addresses on our
		own systems. When a new subscriber provides their email
		address to us, we temporarily store the email address in a file
		on our server for up to one hour to provide a mechanism for
		double opt-in. If the subscriber doesn't double opt-in (by
		following a link sent to their email address), we delete the
		record of their subscription. If the subscriber completes the
		double opt-in, we pass the email address to our email provider
		(see below) and remove the email address from our own server.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every time the web server serves a page or other asset, a log
		is made on our web server. The information that is logged is
		not used for analytical purposes, but does include the IP
		address and user agent of the web browser that was used to
		access the website. This is default behaviour for all web
		servers and provides the proper function of the server and
		protection against malicious use.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a newsletter is sent, our third party email provider
		serves images within the content of the email that are used
		to know when an email's content has been downloaded. This
		information is used to estimate the number of active subscribers
		to the newsletter. This number is shared with our sponsors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third party email provider will store inactive email
		addresses for up to six months, at which point they will be
		removed. If email addresses are deemed as active (by
		downloading the content of the newsletters sent to them),
		they will be kept in the system forever that they continue to
		be active.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unsubscriptions are handled by the third party email
		provider. Once a subscriber unsubscribes, their email address
		is completely removed from the system. There is no other data
		recorded, so an unsubscription can be seen as the method for
		completely removing your data from our systems.
	</p>

	<h2>Our third party e-mail provider</h2>
	<p>
		The name of the email service we currently use is <em>Mailjet</em>.
		We do not expect to change providers at any point, but
		if we do, this document will be updated accordingly, and
		timestamped.
	</p>
	<p>
		This privacy policy document covers how Bright Flair
		uses your data. <a
		href="https://www.mailjet.com/security-privacy/"
		target="_blank">Mailjet's
		privacy policy</a> covers how the third party protects the
		privacy of your data we provide to them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only information we provide to the email provider is the
		email address of a subscriber when they subscribe via the
		website.
	</p>
	<p>
		The email provider adds a link to each sent email's footer to
		unsubscribe. Following the link removes your email address
		from the system and in turn removes all of your information
		stored anywhere in our systems.
	</p>

	<h2>Ask a question</h2>
	<p>
		Feel free to ask us a question regarding our privacy policy.
		If there is anything unclear, we want to improve and ensure
		everything is as clear as possible.
