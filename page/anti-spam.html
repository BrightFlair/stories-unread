	<h1>Anti-spam policy</h1>
	<blockquote>
		This anti-spam policy is version 1, dated 7th January 2018.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		<em>Stories Unread</em> is a newsletter, delivered weekly to
		thousands of subscribers' email addresses. When delivering any
		amount of emails, a level of responsibility is taken by the
		sender to ensure that subscriber email addresses are kept
		private and secure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your email address is stored exactly as we would store
		other sensitive information such as credit card information:
		we do not store/log it anywhere ourselves, and we only
		provide it exactly once to our highly vetted service provider,
		through a secure mechanism.
	</p>

	<h2>Opt-in and unsubscribing</h2>
	<p>
		For visitors to subscribe to the newsletter, a double opt-in
		is required to obtain consent. The first email to be sent to
		a new subscriber is a confirmation email asking to follow a
		link to confirm they consent to receiving a weekly newsletter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every newsletter email sent from us has a clear and prominent
		option to unsubscribe at the bottom of the email body.
		Unsubscribing from the mailing list has immediate effect, and
		upon unsubscribing, all of your data is removed from our
		systems.
	</p>

	<h2>Sponsored content</h2>
	<p>
		Our sole responsibility is to deliver interesting news
		articles and links to our subscribers' inboxes every week.
		Within some of the the newsletters are clearly marked
		sponsored content. This adds an extra layer of responsibility
		to our service: we do not want our subscribers' emails to
		ever be known by the sponsors of certain content, otherwise
		we know how easily this information could be used to send
		unsolicited emails.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only form of sponsorship we receive is in the form of a
		single block of clearly-labelled sponsored content within
		each email. We do not and will not sell email addresses to
		advertisers as we understand that doing so would violate the
		privacy of our valued subscribers.
